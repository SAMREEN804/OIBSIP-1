# OIBSIP-1
Sure, here's a GITHUB description for a business card design for a GRAPHIC DESIGNING internship at OIBSIP :
As a GRAPHIC DESIGNING intern, I had the amazing opportunity to design a business card that reflects the innovative spirit and dynamic culture of OIBSIP . Here’s a glimpse into my design process and the final product:

 Design Inspiration: I wanted the business card to be more than just contact information. It needed to capture the essence of OIBSIP – forward-thinking, user-centric, and visually striking.

 Visual Elements:

Color Palette: I used Cognorise’s brand colors to ensure consistency and brand recognition.
Typography: Clean and modern fonts to maintain a professional yet approachable feel.
Layout: A balanced and intuitive layout that makes the information easily accessible.
 Key Features:


This project was a fantastic learning experience, and I’m thrilled with how it turned out. Special thanks to the OIBSIP team for their guidance and support!
